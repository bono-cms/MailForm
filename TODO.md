TODO List

 * Add new type - text batch inputs
 * Ability to turn forms into wizards
 * Ability to save entered values in localStorage until a form is submitted
 * Hidden inputs fields should be able to populate its values from GET parameters
 * Ability to get Geolocation, IP data and other related information from submissions
 * Form templates
